Simple Java Drum Machine

SimpleAF was originally a project I worked on for a discussion in Programming 1. Future work will include adding up to 8 instruments with option to load instruments from files and song save. 

Known issues:
1. When running at a higher tempo and adding more instruments causes a lag.
